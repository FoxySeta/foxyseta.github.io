## Worldview
As a great fan of countercultures, I am not fond of the Big Tech industry.
The same goes for its business models and their code "quality" standards
(i.e. working at Google is definitely not my dream job). Perhaps,
that's the reason I value open source evangelism so much. Then again,
everyday software development isn't really my thing:
I'd rather focus on something more theoretical. If you want to make me
happy, no need for performant hardware. A blackboard will suffice.
